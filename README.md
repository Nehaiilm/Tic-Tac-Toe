# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project involves the development of a simple and interactive Tic Tac Toe game using 
the Java programming language. The game is a two-player strategy game where players 
alternately mark spaces on a 3x3 grid with their designated symbols (X and O). The objective 
is to align three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal to win.
The project is implemented using object-oriented programming principles, ensuring 
modularity, readability, and maintainability. It includes features like a graphical user interface 
(GUI) for a more engaging user experience, real-time validation of moves, and display of the 
winner or draw at the end of the game. For the backend, the program uses Java's core 
functionalities to handle game logic and decision-making.
